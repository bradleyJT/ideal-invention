Clear instructions for how to RECEIVE data from the microservice you implemented
UML sequence diagram showing how requesting and receiving data work. Make it detailed enough that your partner (and your grader) will understand

To request data from the LinkService.py, you must open the text file "link-service.txt", ensure it is blank using the readline() method, 
and then use the write() method to input the title of a book on the file.

To receive data from the LinkService.py, you must open the text file "link-service.txt", ensure that the file has an updated string from the one that was originally input 
using the readline(), and then copy it using readline().
